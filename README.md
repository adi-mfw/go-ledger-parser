go-ledger-parser: Go Fundamentals &amp; File I/O Utility

This repository contains Proof of Concept 1 (POC 1) of the Accelerated Go Ramp-up.

🎯 Goal

The primary objective of this utility is to demonstrate mastery of core Go fundamentals, including strong typing, struct definition, idiomatic error handling, and file input/output (I/O).

💻 Deliverable

A command-line utility that simulates reading raw transaction data (mock CSV/JSON files), validates critical fields (e.g., amount > 0), processes the data into Go structs, and writes a summarized report to a new output file.

Key Topics Demonstrated

Go Basics: Variables, Functions, Packages.

Data Modeling: Structs, Methods, and a simple Interface for abstraction.

I/O Operations: Using the os, io, and encoding/json packages.

Error Handling: Consistent and idiomatic use of if err != nil.
